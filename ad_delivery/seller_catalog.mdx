## 1. Catalog Fetching (BPP → DSP)

## Goal
The catalog is fetched from BPP's providers (stores) using ONDC API onto DSP.

## Process Flow

### 1. DSP Client → Server

- API `/search` call is made
- Initializes an SSE (Server-Sent Events) Connection
- The unique `message_id` maps out which client made the request for SSE Connection

Example of the payload:

```json
{
  	context: {
         //other-details 
    	    message_id: messageId,
  	},
  	message: {
    	    intent: {
            provider: {
        	    descriptor: {
          	      name: "Provider/Store Name"
               }
            }
    	    }
     }
};

```

### 2. DSP Server → BPP

- A map of `message_id` → SSE Connection is created
- When `/search` is received → pass the call onto BPP's `/search`

### 3. BPP → DSP Server

- Webhook `/neo/on_search` receives responses from BPP
- Forwards responses to DSP Server's `/on_search`

### 4. DSP Server's `/on_search` → DSP Client SSE Listener

- After receiving data in DSP Server's `/on_search`, the response payload contains the `message_id`
- This `message_id` is mapped to the corresponding SSE Connection of the client
- DSP Server sends the response to DSP Client's SSE Listener with the Providers data from required BPP's Providers

## Important Note

The SSE Connection is initiated by the client, and the server terminates it after a TTL (Time To Live) limit (default = 30 seconds). This approach is necessary because ONDC responses can arrive in different stream intervals, not all at once.

## Key Points

| Component | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| DSP Client | Initiates `/search` call and SSE connection |
| DSP Server | Maps `message_id` to SSE connections, forwards requests to BPP |
| BPP | Processes `/search` request, sends responses to `/neo/on_search` |
| DSP Server | Receives responses, maps to correct client, forwards data |
| DSP Client | Receives catalog data through SSE Listener |

This process ensures efficient and real-time catalog fetching from BPP to DSP, accommodating the asynchronous nature of ONDC responses.

## 2. Catalog Push (DSP → ADX)

After fetching the catalog from seller apps, we pass it onto the AdNet server (ADX). Here's how this process works:

### DSP AD Campaign

1. From the fetched Catalog, extract `message['bpp_providers']` as it contains the item details needed for the "Menu".
2. Set the bidding object, defining campaign details for that set of products (see schema below).

### DSP → ADX

1. Push the prepared data to the `/dsp/createAd/` endpoint of ADX.

### Schema of Required Ad Products

For detailed schema information, refer to the [Source](URL_TO_SCHEMA_DOCUMENTATION).

### Endpoint Controller

For implementation details of the endpoint controller, refer to the [Source](URL_TO_CONTROLLER_DOCUMENTATION).

## Process Flow

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | DSP extracts `bpp_providers` from fetched catalog |
| 2 | DSP sets bidding object for campaign details |
| 3 | DSP pushes data to ADX's `/dsp/createAd/` endpoint |
| 4 | ADX processes the received catalog and campaign data |

This process ensures that the catalog fetched from seller apps is efficiently passed to the AdNet server (ADX) for further processing and ad campaign management.
