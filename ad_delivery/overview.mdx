## System Overview

![High Level System Overview](URL_TO_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW_IMAGE)

The Yardstick AdNet system facilitates ad exchange between Seller and Buyer Apps within the ONDC ecosystem. This documentation focuses on the backend services of all apps and their interactions.



## Key Functionalities

### 1. Catalog Fetching for Ad Campaigns

- BPP creates ad campaigns
- BPP sends catalog to DSP and sets bid pricing for items
- DSP fetches catalog from BPP using ONDC `/search` API
- DSP sends catalog and bidding parameters to ADX

### 2. Ad Auction Process

- ADX fetches catalog from DSP
- ADX stores catalog in two parts:
  - Full product details in database
  - Ad metadata in cache
- Ad auction process:
  - Retrieve ads from cache based on keywords/location
  - Rank ads based on metrics, relevance, and match
  - Set price for bid winners (second-price auction)
  - Fetch full results from database for response

### 3. Ad Delivery to Buyer Apps

- BAP creates ad unit
- BAP integrates AdNet SDK script
- Ad delivery triggered by:
  - Page loads (display ads, menu ads)
  - Events (search ads)
- SDK calls ADX to fetch auction winners
- SDK renders ads in BAP
