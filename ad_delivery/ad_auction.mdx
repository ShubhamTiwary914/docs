## Overview

There are three types of ads, each focusing on different aspects:

1. **Search**: Clear intent (keywords) - [Source](URL_TO_SEARCH_SOURCE)
2. **Menu**: Proximity (gps, city, state) - [Source](URL_TO_MENU_SOURCE)
3. **Display**: Indirect intent (user segmentation category - proximity for now) - [Source](URL_TO_DISPLAY_SOURCE)

The auction process involves:
1. An initial filter to fetch a small set of relevant ads from the cached data.
2. Ranking of the selected ads to determine 'n' winners.
3. Budgeting after the auction ends (when no ads are left to process or TTL runs out).

# Ad Auction Process

## 1. Parameters

The ad auction process is initiated on the `/ad/fetch/` endpoint. (Reference: [Source](URL_TO_SOURCE))

### Auction Parameters

```json 
{
    	keywords: string,
    	ttl: number | 1000,
    	floorBid: float
    	city: string,
    	state: string,
    	gps: lat,lon,
    	slots: number | 1,
    	adType: enum(search, display, menu)
}
```



<br />


## 2. Pre-Auction Filter

The filter depends on the type of ad:

### For Keywords / Category (String):
- A search index on keywords is created at ad creation (Inverted Search Index).
- Fuzzy search up to "n" characters (default=3) runs on the user's keywords match.
- Prefix search is also performed.

### For Proximity (Geo):
- A Geo Spatial index is created at ad creation.
- Proximity search for "n" kms is run (default=5).



<br />


## 3. Keywords Ads Ranking Formula


```latex
KQS = (Similarity Score Similarity Weight)
AQS = (CTR 0.4 + CR 0.4 + Recency 0.2) (1 + log(1 + Impressions / 1000))
QS = KQS 0.3 + AQS 0.6 + PQS 0.1
Ad Rank = Max CPC Bid QS

```



Where:
- KQS: Keyword Similarity Score
- AQS: Ad Quality Score
- PQS: Provider Quality Score (0.5)
- CTR (Click Through Rate) = Clicks / Impressions
- CR (Conversion Rate) = Orders / Clicks
- Recency = exp(-Days_Since_Last_Impression / 30)


<br />


## 4. Setting Bid Pricing for Winners

The auction follows the Generalized Second Price Auction (GSP) model:

1. The 1st bidder gets the first slot, the 2nd gets the second slot, and so on.
2. The highest bidder pays the price bid by the second-highest bidder.
3. The second-highest pays the price bid by the third-highest, and so on.

### Exception:
- If the price bid of the (n-1) bidder is more than the (n) bidder, or
- If the (n-1) bidder doesn't exist,
- Then the (n) bidder pays their own price bid.
